	<h2>
		Welcome!
	</h2>

	<p>
		Thank you for visiting my website. This site hosts my portfolio and resume, as well as some of my personal projects and a few associated links.

		<h3>About Me</h3>
		My name is Terence Sperringer. I am a computer programmer who designs, programs, and plays video games.
	</p>

	<p>
		I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in the spring of 2010 with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's of Arts Degree in Japanese Language and Culture. During my time at the University of Pittsburgh I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Tokyo, Japan as a part of Temple University Japan's study abroad program, start a game development club (Coding4Play) with some enthusiastic fellow students, and meet many brilliant and talented people I otherwise might not have.
	</p>

	<p>
		After graduating from Pitt, I got a position working as a staff programmer for Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center. While working there I assisted student projects by joining on as a technical advisor and lending my hand as a pick-up programmer. I was also asked to travel to the ETC's Osaka campus in Japan to ease the hand-off of an interactive experience project for the 2012 Yeosu Expo in Yeosu, South Korea. My three weeks there were a blast, and I have vowed to return to the country again.

	<p>
		In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching Japanese television dramas and animation, playing video games, and developing my own games. Other hobbies include fishing, learning to play piano and guitar, and composing music (or at least attempting to XD). I also love traveling (especially abroad).
